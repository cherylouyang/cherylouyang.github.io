We wake up in a world of technology. From the relentless beeping of alarm clocks ringing incessantly in our ears, to the gratifying `ding ding` of our mobile phones on the nightstand, we eat, breathe and sleep in all the benefits that technology brings to our lives.

<br>

Our lives are so deeply entwined with technology and software, that if we were to extricate ourselves, we would most likely find ourselves yearning to fill a void that was once filled to the brim with modern convenience. We've gotten so used to having everyday tasks automated for us. From food deliveries to home entertainment, there's software out there for just about every aspect of life.

<br>

I came into this world as a child of the internet generation, arguably at a peak of technological development and riding the wave of technological advancement (if we were to consider the late 90s and early 2000s the beginning of a new era for Silicon Valley). I still vividly recall flipping through my little pink phone book in search of the landline numbers of my closest childhood friends for our weekly Saturday calls. Unable to move from my seat next to the telephone except to stretch out my fingers for a piece of fruit, I spent the next hour chatting about whatever it was 10 year olds amused themselves with in the 2010s.

<br>

Growing up with smartphones and computers at my fingertips, I know that I want to pursue a career in tech. Which specific tech stream however, is the question. Does one choose based on what is deemed most practical, or what their gut is telling them?

I've spent the past 2 years in search of the right career path for me. From cybersecurity to forensic technology, network engineering to software engineering, my goal has always been to learn as much as I can and gain as much experience possible before I take my final steps out of university life. The one motto I've always strived to live by is "To have no regrets". Sometimes it's exceedingly difficult to maintain that mindset, so I like to remind myself that there simply is no point in dwelling on the past. Every single decision I've made up until this point has let me to where I am today. Do I sometimes feel like I could've had a slightly smoother career progression if I'd made my mind up earlier? Sure. But then I never would've had the chance to experience working in a range of positions at a variety of companies within different industries.
