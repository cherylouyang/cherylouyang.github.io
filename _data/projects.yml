    summary : Who doesn't love a twist on a classic game?
    description : 
          A game of rock, paper, scissors, lizard, spock, originally created by Sam Kass with Karen Bryla. 
          <br>
          I was inspired by The Big Bang Theory and I was curious to see the different ways I could bring this game to life.
    skills: 
        - python

            I wanted to brush up on my Python skills and entertain myself in the process, so I decided to code up a command line game.
            <br>
            <li>Takes in a number representing scissors, paper, or rock to eliminate the possibility of spelling errors</li>
            <li>Ensures that input is within the range [0,2]</li> 
            <li>Calculates the result by comparing numbers</li> 
            <li>Allows for infinite loops of the game at the discretion of the user</li>

    summary : Too lazy to sort your downloads folder?
    description : A Python script to sort files into folders based on file type.
            <br>
            My downloads folder was getting slightly out of hand but everytime I wanted to go through it, I got overwhelmed at the sheer number of files crammed into the one folder.
            <br>
            So I decided to split them up and sort them into separate folders based on their file type.

        - python
